# GrandMA3 API Documentation for Lua Scripting

## Introduction
Welcome to the comprehensive API documentation for Lua scripting in the GrandMA3 system. This serves as a go-to resource for Lighting Programmers looking to enhance their understanding and extend the capabilities of the GrandMA3 system. Explore detailed descriptions and basic syntax for all current GMA3 system functions.

## Description
This project aims to empower Lighting Programmers by providing comprehensive documentation for interacting with the GrandMA3 System using Lua scripting. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, this documentation serves as a solid foundation for navigating and utilizing the capabilities of Lua in the GrandMA3 environment.

## Main Features
* **GMA3 Lua API:** A well-organized guide featuring each function's description, ensuring a clear understanding of the available features.
* **Modules:** Dedicated modules with detailed information on the basic syntax of functions in the Lua programming language, specifically designed for the GrandMA3 System.
* **Specialized Documents:** Documents for specific modules, such as a x

## Future Updates
I hope to update this project with real-world examples using the above Lua functions. This update will provide Lighting Programmers with practical, real-world examples that allow for a quick start and easy iteration. 

## What is Lua?
Lua is a scripting language designed to support general procedural programming.
It offers support for object-oriented programming, functional programming, and data-driven programming. 
Lua is implemented as a library, written in clean C.

The GrandMA3 software supports Lua version 5.4.4 and all the built-in standard libraries.

For more information on scripting with Lua see: [Lua Docs](www.lua.org).
