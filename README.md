# GrandMA3 API Documentation for Lua Scripting

## Introduction
Welcome to the comprehensive API documentation for Lua scripting in the GrandMA3 system. This serves as a go-to resource for Lighting Programmers looking to enhance their understanding and extend the capabilities of the GrandMA3 system. Explore detailed descriptions and basic syntax for all current GMA3 system functions.

## Description
This project aims to empower Lighting Programmers by providing comprehensive documentation for interacting with the GrandMA3 System using Lua scripting. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, this documentation serves as a solid foundation for navigating and utilizing the capabilities of Lua in the GrandMA3 environment.

## Main Features
* **Docs**
    * **Helpful Keywords:** A list of commonly used keywords for interacting with GrandMA3 Lua functions.
    * **Basic Plugin Information:** A guide detailing the definition of a Lua Plugin, the steps to create one, and useful additional resources for Lua plugin development.
* **Modules** 
    * **Object API**
        * **Documentation:** A guide that explains Object API-defined Lua functions and provides a list of commonly used Object API Lua functions.

        * **Functions:** Examples showcasing the use of Lua Object Free API functions in various scenarios.

## Future Updates
I hope to update this project with real-world examples using the above Lua functions. This update will provide Lighting Programmers with practical, real-world examples that allow for a quick start and easy iteration. 

## What is Lua?
Lua is a scripting language designed to support general procedural programming.
It offers support for object-oriented programming, functional programming, and data-driven programming. 
Lua is implemented as a library, written in clean C.
Lua code can be executed from plugins or directly in the command line using the [Lua Keyword](https://github.com/MacTirney/GrandMA3-API-Documentation/blob/main/Docs/Helpful%20Keywords.md)

The GrandMA3 version 1.9 software supports Lua version 5.4.4 and all the built-in standard libraries.

For more information on scripting with Lua see: [Lua Docs](www.lua.org).
